DESCRIPTION

This module is about the native integer numerical data type.  A native
integer is one of the types of datum that can appear in the numeric part
of a Perl scalar.  This module supplies constants describing the native
integer type.

There are actually two native integer representations: signed and
unsigned.  Both are handled by this module.
